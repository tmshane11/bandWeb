            <h2 style="color:white">ARE YOU GOING TO BE A 6TH GRADER AT PODONK EAST MIDDLE SCHOOL NEXT YEAR?</h2>
            <br /><br />
            <p style="color:white">
              We want you to join the Podonk East Band! Playing in middle school band develops good discipline, a sense of teamwork, and a lifelong love of music.
              <br /><br />
              Here are some frequently asked questions about being in band...<br /><br />
              Do I need to have experience playing a musical instrument to join the band?<br /><br />
              NO! While it's certainly helpful to have experience, particularly taking piano lessons, you do NOT need to have played an instrument before.<br /><br />
              What instruments can I play in 6th grade band?<br /><br />
              You will be able to choose from flute, oboe, bassoon, clarinet, alto saxophone, trumpet, french horn, trombone, euphonium, tuba, or percussion.<br /><br />
              How do I make my decision about what instrument I will play?<br /><br />
              The band directors will help you try out each instrument. Then we will discuss what instruments you could play with success and what choices interest you.<br /><br />
              How do I sign up for band on my schedule?<br /><br />
              Request "BAND" on your course card for the PEMS counselors, who will set up your schedule for next year. Band is a Fine Arts class, and each student must be enrolled in a Fine Arts class each year.<br /><br />
              Are some instruments harder than others?<br /><br />
              NO! But different physical features in your face and hands can affect how well YOU could play something. The shape of your lips, the structure of your teeth, and your overall size all can play a part.
              The band directors will help identify these sorts of characteristics to be sure you play an instrument on which you will have fun AND be successful!<br /><br />
              Does it cost money to be in band?<br /><br />
              All the fine arts classes at Podonk East have a fee. Ours covers the cost of your band shirts, your complete band binder, your method and theory books, music, transportation and entry fees for festivals and trips, and much more.<br /><br />
              Are there ways to fundraise for my band fee?<br /><br />
              YES! We try to offer as many opportunities to fundraise as possible. If you participate in fundraisers, it's possible to raise ALL of the money that you need for band.<br /><br />
              Do band students get to go on field trips?<br /><br />
              YES! Our band students get to attend special festivals and contests for performances, as well as trips to reward your hard work in band. In the past, the band has gone to Sandy Lake Amusement Park, NRH2O, Hawaiian Falls, Six Flags, iTZ, and more!<br /><br />

              •	STEP 1 – Sign up for Band as your first elective choice when choosing your courses<br />
              This is the most important step and the easiest to make. When you place Band as your first elective choice, this ensures that you will have a spot in the beginning band class. If you didn’t enroll in the beginning band class… No Worries! You can attend a Try-the-instrument event (see step 2) and change your schedule later on. There is no need to decide what instrument you are playing, yet… that comes next.<br /><br />
              •	STEP 2 – Attend a “Band Instrument Test Drive” Event<br />
              Get ready for a fun time!!! This is the time that the student sits down with a band director and is able to try any instrument that they want to. During this session, the assigned band director(s) guide the student through the band instruments and make suggestions based on finger dexterity, face and teeth structure, grades, and experience. By the end of this short session, the student will walk away in most instances knowing what instrument is the best fit for them. If the student is interested in percussion, there will be a separate assessment date due to the large amount of interest. Dates for the selection process are in the Calendar Section.<br /><br />
              •	STEP 3 – Attend the Beginning Band Parent Night & Instrument Drive<br />
              This important event will serve two purposes. The first is to offer information to the parents/guardians of all students signed up for a Podonk East Beginning Band Class. We will discuss the schedule, supplies, expectations and what to expect throughout the year (events, concerts, contests, etc.). The second purpose is to provide parents the opportunity to speak with various recommended music store vendors concerning instrument rental and supplies. When working with a recommended vendor, they will have our supply list and be able to offer package deals at competitive prices.<br /><br />
              •	STEP 4 – Rent/Purchase the instrument and supplies<br />
              We highly recommend that parents choose to sign up for a rent-to-own program through our recommended vendors for the first year. This will help ensure that the student is responsible and dedicated to their chosen instrument before an instrument is purchased. Music Stores will also offer instrument repair supplements to cover the costs of any repairs needed while being rented. We highly encourage to take advantage of this during the student’s first year, as they are not only learning how to play the instrument but also how to take care of the instrument. Accidents occur which can be costly!<br /><br />
              •	STEP 5 – Show up to Band Class<br />
              Now the fun REALLY begins! This will be the most rewarding time, full of challenges, experiences and FUN!
